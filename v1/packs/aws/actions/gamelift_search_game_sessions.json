If no filter expression is included, the request returns results for all game sessions in the fleet that are in ACTIVE status. A filter expression can contain one or multiple conditions. Each condition consists of the following:    Operand -- Name of a game session attribute. Valid values are gameSessionName, gameSessionId, creationTimeMillis, playerSessionCount, maximumSessions, hasAvailablePlayerSessions.    Comparator -- Valid comparators are: =, &lt;&gt;, &lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, &gt;=.     Value -- Value to be searched for. Values can be numbers, boolean values (true/false) or strings. String values are case sensitive, enclosed in single quotes. Special characters must be escaped. Boolean and string values can only be used with the comparators = and &lt;&gt;. For example, the following filter expression searches on gameSessionName: 'FilterExpression': 'gameSessionName = 'Matt\\\\'s Awesome Game 1''.    To chain multiple conditions in a single expression, use the logical keywords AND, OR, and NOT and parentheses as needed. For example: x AND y AND NOT z, NOT (x OR y). Session search evaluates conditions from left to right using the following precedence rules:    =, &lt;&gt;, &lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, &gt;=    Parentheses   NOT   AND   OR   For example, this filter expression retrieves game sessions hosting at least ten players that have an open player slot: 'maximumSessions&gt;=10 AND hasAvailablePlayerSessions=true'.
