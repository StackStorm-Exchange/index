            "description": "A JSON document defining one or more segments or subsegments. Segments must include the following fields.  Required Segment Document Fields     name - The name of the service that handled the request.    id - A 64-bit identifier for the segment, unique among segments in the same trace, in 16 hexadecimal digits.    trace_id - A unique identifier that connects all segments and subsegments originating from a single client request.    start_time - Time the segment or subsegment was created, in floating point seconds in epoch time, accurate to milliseconds. For example, 1480615200.010 or 1.480615200010E9.    end_time - Time the segment or subsegment was closed. For example, 1480615200.090 or 1.480615200090E9. Specify either an end_time or in_progress.    in_progress - Set to true instead of specifying an end_time to record that a segment has been started, but is not complete. Send an in progress segment when your application receives a request that will take a long time to serve, to trace the fact that the request was received. When the response is sent, send the complete segment to overwrite the in-progress segment.   A trace_id consists of three numbers separated by hyphens. For example, 1-58406520-a006649127e371903a2de979. This includes:  Trace ID Format    The version number, i.e. 1.   The time of the original request, in Unix epoch time, in 8 hexadecimal digits. For example, 10:00AM December 2nd, 2016 PST in epoch time is 1480615200 seconds, or 58406520 in hexadecimal.   A 96-bit identifier for the trace, globally unique, in 24 hexadecimal digits.  ",
