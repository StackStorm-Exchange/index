Not to be confused with the user-configured AWS account alias, which is set from the IAM console.    owner-id - The AWS account ID of the image owner.    platform - The platform. To only list Windows-based AMIs, use windows.    product-code - The product code.    product-code.type - The type of the product code (devpay | marketplace).    ramdisk-id - The RAM disk ID.    root-device-name - The name of the root device volume (for example, /dev/sda1).    root-device-type - The type of the root device volume (ebs | instance-store).    state - The state of the image (available | pending | failed).    state-reason-code - The reason code for the state change.    state-reason-message - The message for the state change.    tag:key=value - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource.    tag-key - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. This filter is independent of the tag-value filter. For example, if you use both the filter 'tag-key=Purpose' and the filter 'tag-value=X', you get any resources assigned both the tag key Purpose (regardless of what the tag's value is), and the tag value X (regardless of what the tag's key is). If you want to list only resources where Purpose is X, see the tag:key=value filter.    tag-value - The value of a tag assigned to the resource. This filter is independent of the tag-key filter.    virtualization-type - The virtualization type (paravirtual | hvm).  ",
