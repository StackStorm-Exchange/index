If you copy an unencrypted DB snapshot and specify a value for the KmsKeyId parameter, Amazon RDS encrypts the target DB snapshot using the specified KMS encryption key.  If you copy an encrypted DB snapshot from your AWS account, you can specify a value for KmsKeyId to encrypt the copy with a new KMS encryption key. If you don't specify a value for KmsKeyId, then the copy of the DB snapshot is encrypted with the same KMS key as the source DB snapshot.  If you copy an encrypted DB snapshot from your AWS account, you can specify a value for KmsKeyId to encrypt the copy with a new KMS encryption key. If you don't specify a value for KmsKeyId, then the copy of the DB snapshot is encrypted with the same KMS key as the source DB snapshot. If you copy an encrypted snapshot to a different AWS region, then you must specify a KMS key for the destination AWS region. If you copy an encrypted DB snapshot that is shared from another AWS account, then you must specify a value for KmsKeyId.  To copy an encrypted DB snapshot to another region, you must set KmsKeyId to the KMS key ID used to encrypt the copy of the DB snapshot in the destination region.

The PreSignedUrl parameter must be used when copying an encrypted DB snapshot from another AWS region. The presigned URL must be a valid request for the CopyDBSnapshot API action that can be executed in the source region that contains the encrypted DB snapshot to be copied. The presigned URL request must contain the following parameter values:    DestinationRegion - The AWS Region that the encrypted DB snapshot will be copied to. This region is the same one where the CopyDBSnapshot action is called that contains this presigned URL.  For example, if you copy an encrypted DB snapshot from the us-west-2 region to the us-east-1 region, then you will call the CopyDBSnapshot action in the us-east-1 region and provide a presigned URL that contains a call to the CopyDBSnapshot action in the us-west-2 region. For this example, the DestinationRegion in the presigned URL must be set to the us-east-1 region.    KmsKeyId - The KMS key identifier for the key to use to encrypt the copy of the DB snapshot in the destination region. This is the same identifier for both the CopyDBSnapshot action that is called in the destination region, and the action contained in the presigned URL.    SourceDBSnapshotIdentifier - The DB snapshot identifier for the encrypted snapshot to be copied. This identifier must be in the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) format for the source region. For example, if you are copying an encrypted DB snapshot from the us-west-2 region, then your SourceDBSnapshotIdentifier would look like Example: arn:aws:rds:us-west-2:123456789012:snapshot:mysql-instance1-snapshot-20161115.
