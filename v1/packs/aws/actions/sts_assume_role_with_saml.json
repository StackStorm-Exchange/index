An expiration can also be specified in the SAML authentication response's SessionNotOnOrAfter value. The actual expiration time is whichever value is shorter.   This is separate from the duration of a console session that you might request using the returned credentials. The request to the federation endpoint for a console sign-in token takes a SessionDuration parameter that specifies the maximum length of the console session, separately from the DurationSeconds parameter on this API.

            "description": "An IAM policy in JSON format. The policy parameter is optional. If you pass a policy, the temporary security credentials that are returned by the operation have the permissions that are allowed by both the access policy of the role that is being assumed,  and  the policy that you pass. This gives you a way to further restrict the permissions for the resulting temporary security credentials. You cannot use the passed policy to grant permissions that are in excess of those allowed by the access policy of the role that is being assumed. For more information, Permissions for AssumeRole, AssumeRoleWithSAML, and AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity in the IAM User Guide.  The format for this parameter, as described by its regex pattern, is a string of characters up to 2048 characters in length. The characters can be any ASCII character from the space character to the end of the valid character list (\\u0020-\\u00FF). It can also include the tab (\\u0009), linefeed (\\u000A), and carriage return (\\u000D) characters.  The policy plain text must be 2048 bytes or shorter. However, an internal conversion compresses it into a packed binary format with a separate limit. The PackedPolicySize response element indicates by percentage how close to the upper size limit the policy is, with 100% equaling the maximum allowed size. ",
