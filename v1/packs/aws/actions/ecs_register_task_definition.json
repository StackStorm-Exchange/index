The host network mode offers the highest networking performance for containers because they use the host network stack instead of the virtualized network stack provided by the bridge mode; however, exposed container ports are mapped directly to the corresponding host port, so you cannot take advantage of dynamic host port mappings or run multiple instantiations of the same task on a single container instance if port mappings are used.
