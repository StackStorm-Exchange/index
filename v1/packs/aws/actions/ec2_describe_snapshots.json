Not to be confused with the user-configured AWS account alias, which is set from the IAM consolew.    owner-id - The ID of the AWS account that owns the snapshot.    progress - The progress of the snapshot, as a percentage (for example, 80%).    snapshot-id - The snapshot ID.    start-time - The time stamp when the snapshot was initiated.    status - The status of the snapshot (pending | completed | error).    tag:key=value - The key/value combination of a tag assigned to the resource.    tag-key - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. This filter is independent of the tag-value filter. For example, if you use both the filter 'tag-key=Purpose' and the filter 'tag-value=X', you get any resources assigned both the tag key Purpose (regardless of what the tag's value is), and the tag value X (regardless of what the tag's key is). If you want to list only resources where Purpose is X, see the tag:key=value filter.    tag-value - The value of a tag assigned to the resource. This filter is independent of the tag-key filter.    volume-id - The ID of the volume the snapshot is for.    volume-size - The size of the volume, in GiB.  ",
