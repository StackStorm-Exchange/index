For example, for the tag Purpose=X, specify tag:Purpose for the filter name and X for the filter value.    tag-key - The key of a tag assigned to the resource. This filter is independent of the tag-value filter. For example, if you use both the filter 'tag-key=Purpose' and the filter 'tag-value=X', you get any resources assigned both the tag key Purpose (regardless of what the tag's value is), and the tag value X (regardless of what the tag's key is). If you want to list only resources where Purpose is X, see the tag:key=value filter.    tag-value - The value of a tag assigned to the resource. This filter is independent of the tag-key filter.    update-time - The time of the most recent update.  ",
