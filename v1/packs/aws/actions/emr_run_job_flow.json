If the AMI supports multiple versions of Hadoop (for example, AMI 1.0 supports both Hadoop 0.18 and 0.20) you can use the JobFlowInstancesConfig HadoopVersion parameter to modify the version of Hadoop from the defaults shown above.

Previously, the EMR AMI version API parameter options allowed you to use latest for the latest AMI version rather than specify a numerical value.
